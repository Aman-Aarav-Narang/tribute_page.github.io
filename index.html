            Bhagat Singh, (born September 27, 1907, Lyallpur, western Punjab, India [now in Pakistan]—died March 23,
            1931, Lahore [now in Pakistan]), revolutionary hero of the Indian independence movement.
            <br> <br>

            Bhagat Singh attended Dayanand Anglo Vedic High School, which was operated by Arya Samaj (a reform sect of
            modern Hinduism), and then National College, both located in Lahore. He began to protest British rule in
            India while still a youth and soon fought for national independence. He also worked as a writer and editor
            in Amritsar for Punjabi- and Urdu-language newspapers espousing Marxist theories. He is credited with
            popularizing the catchphrase “Inquilab zindabad” (“Long live the revolution”). <br> <br>
            In 1928 Bhagat Singh plotted with others to kill the police chief responsible for the death of Indian writer
            and politician Lala Lajpat Rai, one of the founders of National College, during a silent march opposing the
            Simon Commission. Instead, in a case of mistaken identity, junior officer J.P. Saunders was killed, and
            Bhagat Singh had to flee Lahore to escape the death penalty. In 1929 he and an associate lobbed a bomb at
            the Central Legislative Assembly in Delhi to protest the implementation of the Defence of India Act and then
            surrendered. He was hanged at the age of 23 for the murder of Saunders.

            <p>
                Bhagat Singh was born and raised in a Sikh family in Punjab, India (now Pakistan). He was the second son
                of Kishan Singh and Vidya Vati. The family was inspired by nationalism and participated in independence
                movements. At the time of Bhagat's birth, his father and two uncles were in jail for causing political
                unrest. Khatkar Kalan, near the town of Banga, India, in the Punjab district of Nawanshahr (now called
                Shaheed Bhagat Singh Nagar), was his ancestral village. Arjun Singh, his grandfather, followed Arya
                Samaj, the Hindu reformist movement of Swami Dayananda Saraswati, which had a major influence on Bhagat
                Singh. His father and uncles were members of the Ghadar Party, headed by Kartar Singh Sarabha and Har
                Dayal. Because of pending court proceedings against him, Ajit Singh was forced into exile while Swaran
                Singh died at home in Lahore in 1910, following his release from prison.
